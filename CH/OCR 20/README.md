# OCR Coding Challenges

Welcome to my collection of solutions for the OCR **GCSE** Coding Challenges! These challenges come from the official booklet published by OCR: https://www.ocr.org.uk/Images/202838-20-code-challenges.pdf

To see my solutions for the OCR **A-Level (and GCSE)** Coding Challenges, click [here](https://github.com/TruwanThayaparan/cs-gcse-code/blob/main/CH/OCR/README.md).

## Notes

- I may not complete every challenge, but I'll work through as many as I can.
- Some challenges may not include the extension tasks.
- If you'd like a solution to a challenge I haven't covered yet, feel free to ask ChatGPT for help.

## Credits

- I reviewed and learned from several other people's solutions, including:  
  - https://github.com/Kolawality/OCR-Coding-Challenges/  
  - https://github.com/CodingChallengesBooklet  
  - https://github.com/IsaacChittilappily/OCR-A-Level-Coding-Challenges/  
  - https://www.advanced-ict.info/programming/OCR_coding_challenges.html

- I also used ChatGPT to help fix some bugs and improve my code, but these scripts are mostly my work (not just AI-generated solutions).

## Usage

- Feel free to use any of the code here in your projects. You do **not** need to ask me for permission, as these scripts are straightforward enough to recreate.
- I'd appreciate it if you gave me credit when you use or adapt my code!

Happy coding!
